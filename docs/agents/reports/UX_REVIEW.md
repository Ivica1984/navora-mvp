# UX Review Report

**Owner:** UX/UI Design Architect (`uxa`, owner 2026-10-27). **Process:** [`../README.md`](../README.md), *UX review*. **Reference:** [`../../design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](../../design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md).

Newest dated section first; never edit an earlier section, correct it in a new one. Each finding: `UXR-<n>` | screen and role | severity (`severe`, `high`, `medium`, `low`) | finding | evidence (CI screenshot artifact and commit, file:line) | principle broken (design system §) | testable remedy | issue.

## 2026-10-27 10:40 CET · baseline (seeded by `po`, not a `uxa` review)

The UX review of 2026-10-27 (screenshots of `recovery/main` at `6abf941`, synthetic seed) used the codes U1 to U18; its severe findings are open as issues and placed by the PO. `uxa` takes them over as below and continues from **UXR-1**; the other U-codes of that review (U8 to U15, U17) are not in the repository: UNKNOWN, `uxa` re-finds them from CI screenshots instead of from memory.

| Earlier code | Issue | Severity | Placed in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| U1, U16, U18 | #510 | severe | UX2 (*Next up* 4) | PLANNED |
| U2 | #507 | severe | UX1 (b) | PLANNED |
| U3 | #506 | severe | UX1 (a) | PLANNED |
| U4 | #508 | severe | UX1 (d) | PLANNED |
| U5, U6, U7 | #509 | severe/high | UX1 (c) | PLANNED |

First tasks for `uxa`: (1) check the dark-mode question in design system §3 (UNKNOWN); (2) as soon as UX1-14 produces CI screenshots, a full baseline review of every protected route per role at 390 px and 1440 px; (3) propose tokens for design system §7 before UX2 starts; (4) a benchmark section (modern healthcare and SaaS products), described in words, with the patterns worth adopting and why.
